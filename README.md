# Financial-anomaly-savings-audit
## Project Objective & Scope
The primary objective of this project was to move beyond traditional reporting and develop a data-driven model capable of proactively detecting and quantifying two critical risks within the supply chain. By build a smart, automated system that acts like a hawk, ready to instantly sniff out two major, recurring issues in the supply chain that are draining the firm’s bank account. These are:
1.	Financial Anomalies (Overcharges): Flagging individual transactions where shipping costs were statistically unjustified. This is about flagging transactions where shipping costs were statistically out of the normal range. If Carrier A suddenly charges us triple for a route they usually run cheap, that's a massive red flag, and we catch it automatically.
2.	Operational Anomalies (Quality Risk): Identifying suppliers and products with statistically high defect rates, regardless of official inspection status. This isn't just about money, it's about our reputation, too. We're spotting suppliers whose stuff keeps breaking, failing quality checks, or showing defect rates that are totally sketch.

The ultimate goal is to provide the firm with a Savings Prioritization Hub that translates complex statistical findings into clear, actionable business insights, directly linking cost anomalies to specific accountable parties (Suppliers and Carriers). The analysis covered 100 sample shipment transactions, evaluating key fields including shipping costs, Cost per unit shipped, Defects rate, and operational fields such as, infection results, Supplier name, and Shipping carriers. The resulting dashboard allows for interactive analysis across all major dimensions, including product type, Location, etc.
